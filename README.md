# Major-Project_Credit_Default_Risk_Prediction

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.

A major NBFC (Non Banking Financial Corporation), strives to broaden financial inclusion for the unbanked population by providing a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience, this NBFC wanted to leverage on data scence to see if prediction can help them in making better decisions.

I had tried to built various machine learning models in order to built a Probability of Default model (PD) for this NBFC, which would help them in predicting their clients' repayment abilities, so that crtical decisions can be taken on those clients who might default and doesnt cause much burden to the company thereafter.

Apart from the data preprocessing, the R Script mainly contains two processes-

Feauture Selection - The first part, aims in identifying the major variables that should be taken care for our final prediction as more number of variables would result in reducing the accuracy of our model.

Developing models - The Second part, tries to build various machine learning models after identifying the various predictor variables from the first step.
